# Smart-Security-Camera

These are the project files for a program I made that uses a facial recognition, with the face_recognition Python library, to detect "unauthorized" people (parents) in my room. If there is a parent in my room, it will send me an email.

The security camera also runs a website I coded using the Flask framework, which contains a livestream of my room, 

The program is meant to run from my Raspberry Pi.
